# GME Privileged Information Platform RSS handler
2019
Written in Python

Just a quick hack, could use much polish.
For now all it does is:

- Fetches data from the GME PIP public RSS feed (using requests)
- Persists data inside a SQLite database (using PonyORM)
- Exposes a RESTful endpoint to pull data from the database (using Flask and Flask_RESTful)
